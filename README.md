# HERMES Ontology
An ontology to support thematic descriptions of cultural heritage

## Context

Cultural heritage is the aggregation of multiple and heterogeneous facets of a certain society, territory, and historical background. A cross-thematic approach to cultural heritage is necessary to provide users (e.g., tourists) with a detailed description of habits, traditions, places, events, and connections with other cultures. It is necessary to characterize the geographic and structural features, as well as the cultural qualities, of tangible entities that are part of a specific territory and are relevant from a heritage perspective. However, it is equally important to characterize intangible cultural entities that correlate with the tangibles of a territory and may identify ``semantic connections'' with other cultures and traditions.

The ability to semantically correlate intangibles with tangibles is key to unlocking hidden relationships between places, history, religion, food, and local traditions. In this context, the __HERMES Ontology__ is the result of a research effort aiming at supporting a multiperspective description of cultural entities and their semantic correlations with the intangible heritage. HERMES is a domain ontology \[1\] based on a solid theoretical background defined by DOLCE \[2\], and extending the ontological model ArCo \[4,5\].
